GPUs in HPC
-----------

GPUs come together with software stacks or APIs that  work in conjunction with the hardware and give a standard way for the software to interact with the GPU hardware. They  are used by software developers to write code that can take advantage of the parallel processing power of the GPU, and they provide a standard way for software to interact with the GPU hardware Tipically they provide access to low-level functionality, such as memory management, data transfer between the CPU and the GPU, and the scheduling and execution of parallel processing tasks on the GPU. They may also provide higher level functions and libraries optimizied for specific HPC  workloads, like linear algebra or fast Fourier transforms. Finally, in order to facilitate the developers to optimize and write correct codes, debugging  and profiling tools are also included. 

*Nvidia*, *AMD*, and *Intel* are the major companies which design and produces GPUs for HPC providing each its own suit **CUDA**, **ROCm**, and respectively **OneAPI**. This way they can offer optimization, differentiation (offering unique features tailored to their devices), vendor lock-in, licensing, and royalty fees, which can result in better performance, profitability, and customer loyalty. 
There are also cross-platorm APIs such **DirectCompute** (only for Windows operating system) and **OpenCl**.
