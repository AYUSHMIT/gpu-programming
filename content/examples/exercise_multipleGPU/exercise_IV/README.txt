Exercise IV: Evaluate the performance

Note: The MPI code is stored in the folder "mpi"

4. Evaluate the execution time of the accelerated codes in the exercises II and III, and compare it with that of a pure MPI implementation.

To compile the MPI code: "./compile.sh"

To submit a job: "sbatch script.slurm"
